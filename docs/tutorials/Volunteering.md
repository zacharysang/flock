Volunteering your computing resources to flock is easy!

When you volunteer your computer to help with distributed computing projects
all you're doing is opening a browser tab! Your computer will, in the 
background, run code that helps other users do complex work, research, and
solve difficult problems.  

# Getting Started
Visit the flock website, and click the button to volunteer. It's that easy!
You can watch the page to see how your work is helping the cause!

# FAQ
## Is my computer at risk?
No. Flock takes advantage of security built into your browser to keep our
volunteers safe. 
## Can I run flock in multiple tabs at once?
Yes! You can run flock in as many tabs as you'd like, and for as long as you'd
like.
